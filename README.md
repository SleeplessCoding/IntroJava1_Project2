Application Purpose

Jimmy John’s Gourmet Sandwiches offers a fairly decent size menu of sandwich selections.  The company’s motto is “sandwiches in 60 seconds or less” and they truly aim for this goal. What better way for them to increase productivity then through an online ordering system. As an example we will be using their Slims portion of their menu which consists of 5 basic sandwiches: Ham & cheese, Roast Beef, Tuna Salad, Turkey Breast and The double provolone (veggie). The sandwiches are all the same size and come on the same 8 inch sub bread. 
There are a few options for sides such as chips cookie and pickles, of course they also sell drinks. To keep it simple we have added the cookie and the pickle option to the ordering system. This will allow us to set the base code for side orders and then expand to the chips and drink options once all, if any, bugs have been worked out. The variants between the sandwiches are the cost and the overall total with additional sides. This will be worked into the ordering system
